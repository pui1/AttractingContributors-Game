3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.
3. Make 10 Pull Request contributions to other projects

# What is your favourite game? 
Recently I like factorio. Factorio is a game for creating an efficient factory.

It is a 2D game and easy on the eyes. I used to play FPS games a lot, but nowadays I don't play much.
